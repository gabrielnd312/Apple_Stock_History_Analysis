Apple is one of the largest companies in the world in the field of electronics and software. It was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.

The duo attempted to sell their project to HP and Atari, but both companies declined, stating that personal computers had no future in the market. Faced with the disbelief of major companies in their work, the pair decided to produce computers using their own resources and sell them independently.
